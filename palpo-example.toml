### Palpo Configuration
###
### THIS FILE IS GENERATED. CHANGES/CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE REPO WILL BE
### OVERWRITTEN!
###
### You should rename this file before configuring your server. Changes to
### documentation and defaults can be contributed in source code at
### crate/server/config/server.rs. This file is generated when building.
###
### Any values pre-populated are the default values for said config option.
###
### At the minimum, you MUST edit all the config options to your environment
### that say "YOU NEED TO EDIT THIS".
###
### For more information, see:
