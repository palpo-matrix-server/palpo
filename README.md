Palpo is a next-generation Matrix homeserver implementation written in Rust, designed for high performance, scalability, and robust federation. Built on the Salvo web framework and PostgreSQL database, Palpo delivers enterprise-grade real-time messaging and collaboration while maintaining minimal operational overhead.

## 🌟 What is Matrix?

Matrix is an open standard for decentralized, real-time communication. It enables:
- **End-to-end encrypted messaging** - Secure conversations by default
- **Federated architecture** - No single point of control or failure
- **Interoperability** - Bridge with other chat platforms (Slack, Discord, IRC, etc.)
- **VoIP and Video Calling** - Built-in support for voice and video
- **Rich messaging** - Reactions, threads, file sharing, and more

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Try Our Demo Server

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Test Server Notice**

Our test server is for **evaluation and testing purposes only**:
- **URL**: `https://test.palpo.im`
- **⚠️ All data on this server will be periodically deleted without notice**
- **Do NOT use for production or store important conversations**
- **Expected to be reset frequently for testing purposes**

#### Connect with Cinny (Web Client)
1. Open [Cinny](https://app.cinny.in/)
2. Click "Edit" on the homeserver selection
3. Enter `https://test.palpo.im` as your custom homeserver
4. Create a test account and start chatting!

#### Connect with Element (Desktop/Mobile)
1. Download [Element](https://element.io/download)
2. On login screen, click "Edit" next to the homeserver
3. Enter `https://test.palpo.im`
4. Register or login

**Production Server**:
- **URL**: [https://matrix.palpo.im](https://matrix.palpo.im)
- This is a more stable instance, but still under active development
